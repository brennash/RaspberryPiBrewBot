# Guide to Brewing
Aside from building the brewbot temperature controller, the most difficult part of the process is getting everything ready for your brew. 

This guide assumes you're starting with some home-brew kit, like the [Cooper's home-brew kit](https://www.homebrewwest.ie/coopers-original-dark-ale-classic-old-dark-ale-17kg-beer-kit-251-p.asp) that I've got fermenting at this moment. 
Home brew kits should consist of three things, 

* The malt extract, which can come in a tin can or a sachet.
* A big bag (1 kg) of finely ground sugar, sometimes called things like flavour enhancer or brew enhancer. However, it's just sugar. 
* A small (10 g) sachet of dry yeast. 

Basically if you put all these things into a big bucket, added tepid water, and left it for a week you'd have beer. It's as simple as that. People brew booze in prison radiators with 
fruit juice and bits of chewed up bread, how hard can it be? 

## Naming conventions
As befitting a process that's been around for thousands of years, it's got a lot of its own terms and naming conventions. For clarity, we've listed a few of them here.

* ***wort*** - the mixture of malt extract, sugar and water in your fermenter.
* ***pitching*** - chucking in brewing yeast into your wort, either in dry or liquid form. 
* ***gravity*** - a measure of the remaining sugar content of your wort, which provides an indication of the strength of your beer. 

## Kit
Aside from our [homebrew kit](https://www.thehomebrewcompany.ie/mangrove-jacks-craft-series-nz-pale-ale-22kg-40-pints-p-3593.html), we need a few items to hold the beer while it's 
being produced by the brewing yeast.

* A carboy/fermenter, basically a [big plastic bucket](![Alt text](https://www.homebrewwest.ie/brewingfermentation-bucket-brewferm-30-l-graduated-2215-p.asp) to let things brew.
* Some [sanitizer](https://www.thehomebrewcompany.ie/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1426) to clean everything before you start brewing.
* An airlock, which fit in a hollow rubber bung in the top of the fermenter.
* A [thermometer](https://www.screwfix.ie/p/im21-immersion-tip-digital-thermometer/942cf) that can be used in liquids.
* Some PVC tubing with a tap to extract the beer from the fermenter into bottles.
* A [syphon](https://www.homebrewwest.ie/craft-range-45-cm-siphon-simply-demijohns-buckets-fermenters-5019-p.asp) to attach to one end of the PVC tubing and go in the fermenter when you're bottling. 
* Some empty bottles, bottle caps and a [capper](https://www.kraftykellys.com/products/bottle-capper-twin-lever-emily). 
* A [hydrometer](https://www.thehomebrewcompany.ie/hydrometer-p-94.html) to figure out the strength of your brew. 

Obviously the first three or four of these are absolutely essential, with the rest you can make do without more than likely. Take for example the hydrometer, do you really care if your final 
brew is 4.1% or 4.2% proof? You're going to drink it anyway. 

## Preparations - Cleaning
Open the lid on your fermenter, assuming it's a plastic bucket type fermenter. Now put in the recommended volume of sanitizer and water, typically it's something like 10ml of sanitizer 
in 5 litres of water. Get a new unused cleaning cloth or sponge and wash down the inside of the fermenter with the cleaning water, as well as the lid. Chuck anything that will come into 
contact with your brewing beer, including your thermocouple, airlock, and anything you're going to use to stir the mixture. Leave everything soak for half an hour. 

## Preparations - Making a Yeast Starter
Pitching is the process of adding yeast to wort to start fermentation and produce beer. Usually, with the homebrew kit you get a small packet of dry yeast. They say on the instructions 
to sprinkle this dry yeast on top of your wort. However, some brewer recommend making a yeast starter, by adding your dry yeast to a cup of sugar water about 30 minutes before you're ready 
to brew.
